# PuzzleStore1
## Description
PuzzelStore is an inventory app that will allow a store to keep track of its inventory of store's products.
The app will store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product.
It will allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.
## What I learned
* Stored information in a SQLite database
* Integrated Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
* Presented information from files and SQLite databases to users
* Updated information based on user input.
* Created intents to other apps using stored information.
